She is skeptical about the notion of genies fulfilling wishes, preferring to take action to secure what she desires. Her motivations are sometimes questioned by others, such as Chireadan, particularly when she provides magical assistance to Dandilion.\n\nIn her dealings with Geralt, Yennefer demonstrates both a willingness to help and a desire to exert control, demanding a seal from him and showing curiosity about his abilities. Despite her manipulative tendencies, she also displays moments of vulnerability, such as when she kneels by Geralt and discusses the escape of a djinn, or when she tries to protect him by creating a portal for his escape.\n\nYennefer's character is further complicated by her past quarrels, including a recent conflict with Nenneke, and her reputation as a witch cursed by the gods.

Geralt expresses deep concern for Yennefer's safety, attempting to dissuade her from using the djinn's power, which indicates a protective instinct towards her. However, he is also cautious around her, feeling a mix of gratitude for her healing abilities and fear of being found by her, prompting him to want to leave the temple.\n\nThe complexity of their relationship is further highlighted by moments of physical struggle, where Geralt physically restrains Yennefer to prevent the djinn from escaping, leading to altercations that reveal the urgency and intensity of their situation.

This act of healing not only showcases her magical prowess but also complicates her motivations, as they are questioned by Chireadan. Despite the doubts surrounding her intentions, Yennefer continues to provide magical assistance to Dandilion, indicating a level of commitment to him.\n\nFurthermore, Yennefer's plans to summon the Djinn involve Dandilion, which puts him at risk, suggesting that her needs may overshadow his safety.
