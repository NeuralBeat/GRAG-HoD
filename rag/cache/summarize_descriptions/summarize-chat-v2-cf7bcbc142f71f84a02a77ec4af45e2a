Nenneke exhibits a protective attitude towards the temple and its inhabitants, often intervening in conflicts and advocating for the well-being of others, including Geralt and Iola. \n\nHer relationship with Geralt is complex; she shows care for him, providing elixirs and medicine, and expresses concern about his well-being, particularly regarding his fear of being discovered.
