{"result": "Master Irion is a character with a complex background and multiple roles. He is a resident wizard known for his expertise and interest in creatures like the kikimora, indicating he might find them useful. Despite this, he prefers to speak privately with Geralt and dismisses the presence of the kikimora during their conversation. Master Irion is also expected to examine the kikimora and make his own conclusions, showcasing his analytical skills and responsibility towards the safety of the neighborhood. Additionally, he is recognized as the original creator of the tower in Kovir, a significant achievement, although he passed away about two hundred years ago.
