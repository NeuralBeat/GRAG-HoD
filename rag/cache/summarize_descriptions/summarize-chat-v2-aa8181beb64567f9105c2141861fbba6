{"result": "Aridea is a complex character deeply concerned with her country's fate, driven by both political and personal motivations. She is depicted as a wise and educated woman, married to Fredefalk, and comes from a family with many exceptional adepts of the magical arts. Aridea's actions are influenced by a prediction from a mirror, prompting her to take significant steps regarding her kingdom's future.\n\nIn her pursuit of power and influence, Aridea tracked down a character referred to as \"the little one\" and hired assassins to eliminate Shrike, although her plans ultimately led to her own poisoning. Additionally, her children, born out of wedlock, are noted to have no claim to the throne, which adds a layer of complexity to her character and motivations.\n\nAridea is also mentioned in connection with Stregobor, as they both played roles in disrupting Renfri's life, indicating her involvement in the darker aspects of political intrigue.
