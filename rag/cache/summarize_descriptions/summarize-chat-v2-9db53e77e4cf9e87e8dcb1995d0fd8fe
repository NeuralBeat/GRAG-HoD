He shares a critical perspective on her actions, indicating a level of bitterness and frustration about the situation involving Geralt.\n\nChireadan has a moment of eye contact with Geralt, suggesting a level of communication or understanding between them. He shows concern for Geralt's well-being, particularly when Geralt regains consciousness, and he is present during moments of urgency, such as when he expresses worry about the effects of a spell on Dandilion's vocal cords. Chireadan also demonstrates empathy and understanding towards Geralt, indicating a close relationship and an ability to comprehend Geralt's motivations, which he explains to Dandilion.\n\nIn addition to his interactions with Geralt, Chireadan is involved in a serious situation where a sentence will be passed by councillors, and he gestures across his neck, indicating the dire consequences that may follow.
