He is deeply concerned about the well-being of a little girl, likely a princess, and actively seeks the advice of Geralt, the witcher, whom he regards as wise. This concern highlights his role as a protective leader. Foltest's authority is further emphasized by the way a brigand shows deference to him, bending double in acknowledgment of his power and influence.\n\nIn addition to his protective instincts, Foltest is embroiled in discussions regarding the potential execution of a witcher, which suggests a tense atmosphere where the safety of individuals is at stake. He is also involved in measures aimed at safeguarding someone from attacks, indicating his proactive approach to governance and security.\n\nMoreover, Foltest's position is precarious, as there are discussions about his removal from the throne, underscoring the political intrigue surrounding his reign.
