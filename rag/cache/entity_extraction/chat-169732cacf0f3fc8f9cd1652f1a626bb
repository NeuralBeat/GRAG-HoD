Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

There was something very \nstrange in Renfri's voice - something associated with the red reflection of fire on blades, the \nwailing of people being murdered, the whinnying of horses and the smell of blood. Others \nmust also have had similar associations - even Tavik's weather-beaten face grew pale. \n\n'Well, white-hair,' Renfri broke the silence. 'Let's go into the larger room. Let's join the \nalderman you came with. He wants to talk to me too, no doubt.' \n\nAt the sight of them, Caldemeyn, who was waiting at the counter, broke off his quiet \nconversation with the innkeeper, straightened himself and folded his arms across his chest. \n\n'Listen, young lady,' he said severely, not wasting time with banal niceties, 'I know from this \nwitcher of Rivia here what brings you to Blaviken.
